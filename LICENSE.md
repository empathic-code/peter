If you are a bad person, this license will not keep you from doing bad things, such as not citing the original source, claiming the work of others as your own or ignoring this license alltogether. If you are a good person, the license is unnecessary, because you would do these things anyway. The following defines things that you MUST and MUST NOT, things that you SHOULD, and things that you MAY do.

You MAY
-------

You may freely use the provided software to entertain yourself, learn about my code, or laugh about my coding. You may run the software privately to see if and how it works. You may modify, change, delete, add and test the code. You may run the software publically to reproduce the scientific claims made in my Bachelor thesis and subsequent works. You may run the software publically to generate data and support your own scientific claims.

You SHOULD
----------

When you run the software, you should give credit and clearly indicate what alterations you made to the software, so that your claims are reproducible. If you publish your findings in a scientific paper, blog, website, you should link to this website and use the following citation:

You MUST
--------

If you wish to run this software and make it available to the public, you must change the provided branding, such as names of people involved and the logos of the institutions included. Names to look out for are the names of my university, their logo, my supervisor and my own. If you run the software to generate data on servers controlled by you, in such a way that it is available to the public or an almost public group (such as freely over the internet or to the audience of a conference) you may not claim that I or my University is officially supporting your project. In this case you still must indicate the original authorship.

You MUST NOT

Sell this software or parts of it, not even as a subset of your own product.
